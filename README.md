# jmsdnns.vim

Welcome to JmsDnns's Vim environment

My goal for this config is to keep things simple, yet powerful; colorful, yet subtle; and both easy to understand or configure.

# Plugins

The plugins I use are:

* [ctrl-p](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim)
* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

# Theme

I use a theme called Nord. It's an arctic, north-bluish clean and elegant theme.

* [nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim)

For Nord to look correct you'll need to install the colors in your terminal too.

* [macOS Terminal](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-terminal-app)
* [Gnome Terminal](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-gnome-terminal)

More Terminal options are available on the Nord theme page if use something else.
